# WhatsApp_Chatbot

The bot needs to be connected to your phone by an QR code once at the beginning of a session. Afterwards it scans for new messages every 5 minutes. 
Once a new message arrives, the bot will take it as input and (hopefully) find an appropriate reply. After sending the message, the bot waits 100 seconds for a reply (you can adjust this) 
 To start the bot run the __interact.py__ file. 
 
If you have any questions please rech out!
